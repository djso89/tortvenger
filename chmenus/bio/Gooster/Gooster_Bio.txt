        Nick 'Gooster' Goosier is the
post-goose who works at the USPS. His 
supervisor always grounds him with 
overtime. He developed
his own mail sorting and throwing
techniques from the repetitive 
tasks during his shift.
     He specializes in long-range attack.
However, he lacks the mobility and can't
jump well. He is vulnerable in close-range.
